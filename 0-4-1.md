## Usage of models
All trained models should be kept in the `saved_models` folder.

#### Loading models
```python
model = load_data(filename)
```

#### Prediction
```python
model.predict(data)
```

## Training instructions
Arguments: Model type (BaseModel/CNN/LSTM/GRU), number of layers, version number
```
$ python3 train.py <modelname> <nlayers> <version>
```
If you do not want weights to be factored in,
go to `keras_model.py` and comment out line 61
```python
61|       # sample_weight=[weight, weight]
```

## Testing instructions
Arguments: Name of saved model file
```
$ python3 test.py <filename>
```
Note that when using the v1 models,
`INPUT_COLS` will have to be edited at line 7 of `load_data.py` as follows:
```python
7|    INPUT_COLS.extend(["p{}_x".format(pnum), "p{}_y".format(pnum), "p{}_z".format(pnum), "n{}".format(pnum)])
```

## Experimentation history
- Ver 1: forgot to include accuracy metric, but obtained very high (negative) loss
- Ver 4: still 0 accuracy :(
